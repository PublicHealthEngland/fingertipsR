This package provides data from the Fingertips API owned by Public Health England.
I have overhauled a number of the tests which increases the speed of testing and allows flexibility in the data provided by the API

## Test 

* local Windows 10 install, R 3.6.2
* used Travis to check on Linux (2020-01-66)

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTEs, WARNINGs or ERRORs.

## Downstream dependencies

No errors with downstream dependencies
