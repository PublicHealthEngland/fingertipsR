The API recently changed structure resulting package tests causing errors. These have all been fixed.
I have also attempted to make the tests more robust against future API changes.

## Test 

* local Windows 10 install, R 3.6.0
* used Travis to check on Linux (2019-05-18)

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTEs, WARNINGs or ERRORs.

## Downstream dependencies

No errors with downstream dependencies
