This package allows users to pull data from an API into their R environment. This resubmission is because the structure of the data in the API has changed, so some of the code needed modification to reflect this change.

## Test

* used Travis to check on Linux (05/10/2017)

## R CMD check results

There were no WARNINGs or ERRORs.
