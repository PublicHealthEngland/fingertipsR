This package allows users to pull data from an API into their R environment. 

This is a resubmission (following one I did on Friday 2nd Feb - I'm really sorry!). One of the new functions, albeit a minor one, returned incorrect information due to me using sprintf incorrectly (I used %o instead of %s). I thought it would be better to update it immediately rather than wait a few months.

## Test 

* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* used Travis to check on Linux (5/2/2018)

## R CMD check results

There were no WARNINGs or ERRORs.
I have 1 x NOTE because I submitted version 0.1.4 three days ago. See above for justification (whether acceptible or not, I will take your judgement)

## Downstream dependencies

No errors with downstream dependencies
