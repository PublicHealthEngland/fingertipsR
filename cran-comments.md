The API recently changed structure resulting package tests causing errors. These have all been fixed.
I'm resubmitting v0.2.6 having fixed issues after feedback from a submission of version 0.2.5 yesterday.

## Test 

* local Windows 10 install, R 3.6.0
* used Travis to check on Linux (2019-06-07)

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTEs, WARNINGs or ERRORs.

## Downstream dependencies

No errors with downstream dependencies
