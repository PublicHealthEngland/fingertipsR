This package allows users to pull data from an API into their R environment. The reason for the resubmission of the package soon after my previous submission is that I have added the functionality to use local proxy settings when pulling the data from the API. A large part of the package's user base work in local authorities, and many of them were facing issues as a result of their local proxy settings.

## Test 

* local Windows 7 install, R 3.5.0
* used Travis to check on Linux (25/5/2018)

## R CMD check results

## Downstream dependencies
